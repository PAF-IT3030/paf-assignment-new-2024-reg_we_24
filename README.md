Brief Description of your Solution - 
Our client seeks to create a social media platform for fitness enthusiasts to share workouts, meal plans, and progress. Users can upload photos/videos, share workout statuses, and interact with others through likes/comments. The platform will prioritize user-friendliness and allow login via social media accounts. Our role involves developing a web application and REST API, ensuring seamless integration with future web apps.

The functions that are related to our web application.

• User management Users can sign up/login to share their food and dining experiences, posting up to 3 photos or videos (30 seconds max) per post. They can also upload fitness activities and progress updates similarly. Descriptions can accompany posts, and uploads can be done directly from devices. All content will be displayed in a community feed for engagement.

• Realtime workout status update management Enable users to create and share updates on their current workout status, such as distance ran, number of pushups completed, weight lifted, etc. Provide predefined templates for users to input their workout metrics, making it easy to track and share their progress. Each post should include a brief description of the fitness achievement (provided by the user).

• Workout plan sharing management Allow users to share their workout plans, including routines, exercises, sets, and repetitions. Provide templates for users to create and customize their workout plans within the platform. Enable users to update their workout plans over time as their fitness goals and preferences evolve.

• Meal plan sharing Management Enable users to share their meal plans, including recipes, nutritional information, and portion sizes. Provide tools for users to create and document their meal plans, including options for adding ingredients, cooking instructions, and photos of prepared meals. Implement features for users to categorize their meal plans based on dietary preferences, such as vegetarian, vegan, keto, etc.
